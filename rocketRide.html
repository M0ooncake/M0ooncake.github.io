    Bullet points over explanations.
    quicker the better, notes on the bottom if you want to elaborate things.
    the deep dive would be better on the bottom so the bullet points can be quickly
    read through on top, logos for software used is good to make it more visual,
    sort of list team size, achievements for what was done, roles you played in the 
    project. Its a matter of avoiding a wall of text, essay style, those arent super
    helpful, peoples attentions spans are to short for that these days.
    
    overall
    visuals are good, logos for software, engines, all that stuff.
    Try to get an image real quick off the rip so it comes across the glance.
    visuals visuals visuals. I compiled sprite sheets, show em off.
    
    
    colour scheme, try and use more solid colours rather then gradient. The gradient
    loses some contrast and loses some readability.

                &emsp; This game was created during term 5 of 6 during my schooling at TFS. Even more 
                specifically, this was made for physics. Over the course of the term there was probably
                3-4 games in active development at once. A lot of mental fog to juggle all throughout.
                Needing to switch mind sets entirely each time I'd switch to developing a different game,
                needing to reexamine how everything was done, and try to forget all the details of the 
                other projects in the work.

                &emsp; The goal of this mini-game was to get somewhat familiar with how Unreal Engine handles
                different aspects of physics. And how to interface with those to create features within 
                the Game Engine.

                &emsp;  The damage that gets dealt to the ship is a formula that bases it on the ships
                velocity. That way the faster you go, the more damage the ship takes, and vice versa.
                If you are careful and were to fly around very slowly, you could in theory hit every
                surface and be totally fine. So long as it was actually just gentle love tap.

                <br><br>&emsp; There were also pickups as well to allow for health to be regained, 
                healing by 20% of max health.

            &emsp; While I was developing this game, the Alice In Public Domain was also in full swing.
            So I decided that the fastest option would be to use a very similar system to what I 
            was already using within Alice, CommonUI. And stacks. Though I only needed one 
            stack since this was a very simple project. 
            <br><br>&emsp; It was fun however to mess around with the Animations tool to make some
            animations for the menu. Sliding them around and sheering the buttons.
