    Notes on portfolio item construction
    Bullet points over explanations.
    quicker the better, notes on the bottom if you want to elaborate things.
    the deep dive would be better on the bottom so the bullet points can be quickly
    read through on top, logos for software used is good to make it more visual,
    sort of list team size, achievements for what was done, roles you played in the 
    project. Its a matter of avoiding a wall of text, essay style, those arent super
    helpful, peoples attentions spans are to short for that these days.
    
    overall
    visuals are good, logos for software, engines, all that stuff.
    Try to get an image real quick off the rip so it comes across the glance.
    visuals visuals visuals. I compiled sprite sheets, show em off.
    
    
    colour scheme, try and use more solid colours rather then gradient. The gradient
    loses some contrast and loses some readability.

        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp; I want to say special thanks to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hishamata/">Hisham Ata</a>.
            &emsp; One of the instructors at Toronto Film School who had a heavy hand in my ability to get this
            far in the first place. For whom without, this project would not be have come together 
            in the first place. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp; Android. It was a whole other beast then Windows. For so many reasons.
            <br><br>
            &emsp; Before I even started writing code, there background research I wanted to do.
            Allow me to ask, 
            <br> &emsp; if you wanted to kill a few minutes of time, would you be more likely to
            open a small game that was portrait? Or a small game that was landscape?
            <br><br>
            &emsp; From the research I did, the people that were asked. Almost everyone was more 
            inclined to play a portrait game. Why? Convenience. Industry trends, especially media,
            all play off of convenience. I would wager TikTok would not have been nearly as successful if
            it were landscape.

            &emsp; Talk about the menuing system/back end. Talk about control scheme, simple, 
            intuitive design. Talk about level design, 
            the layering prefab with many layers to accomplish a set goal with each one.
            go into detail about item pickups,
