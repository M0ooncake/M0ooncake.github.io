    the deep dive would be better on the bottom so the bullet points can be quickly
    read through on top, logos for software used is good to make it more visual,
    sort of list team size, achievements for what was done, roles you played in the 
    project. Its a matter of avoiding a wall of text, essay style, those arent super
    helpful, peoples attentions spans are to short for that these days.
    
    overall
    visuals are good, logos for software, engines, all that stuff.
    Try to get an image real quick off the rip so it comes across the glance.

                right page. Then used the Animations tool in Unreal Engine to put together the animation of
                the book opening and closing.

                feel like it was on rope that stretched as it moved down.

                to worked around that.

                <br> &emsp; The Select Screen. It was an interesting challenge to make this screen. I had never attempted
                to have a 3D object be included in the menu before. Using a SceneCaptureComponent2D, a Canvas Render Texture, and a lot
                of tweaking the cameraâ€™s settings finally got it working. Learning how to achieve that, will absolutely be a helpful
                skill in the future.

            <p class="text-box">
                <br> &emsp; Collectibles screen. Unreal Engine does a lot of things well. 
                But List Views are not one of them. the process for trying to get a scrolling 
                list into the game was very painful. Unlike Unity, which has a mostly self-contained 
                implementation, Unreal Engine's List Views were absolutely a pain to get working. 
                Requiring 4 different files. 
                <br><br>   &emsp;A struct with the data you want to have in the list,
                <br>  &emsp;A List Template, what each entry item will have.
                <br>  &emsp;A List View Data Entry, used in the List Template to build part of the struct.
                <br>  &emsp;Finally the Widget where you use all of them.
                <br><br> &emsp; Putting all that together you now have a list view. That was a very slow
                process to figure out how exactly to use all those in unison to make it. 
                But eventually it was figured out.

            <p class="text-box">
                <br> &emsp; The Character Swapping Menu. It took awhile to solidify a design for it.
                And took even longer to put it all together. There were a lot of ridiculous, illogical issues 
                that I had with CommonUI not moving a controllers focus to other cards. I think it involved
                how much of one card was covering the other, if too much was covered, it COULD NOT, be 
                highlighted. Regardless of the Navigation rule, be it Escape or Explicit, it would not 
                receive the controller's focus. This theory doesn't make much of any logical sense,
                but it appeared to be the cause of that particular issue.
                
                <br><br> &emsp; The card popping up and down was done by adjusting it's position based on 
                the card's On Hover, and On Unhovered. To emulate the feel of thumbing through a deck of cards.
                The cards rotating was done with a custom function as the navigation. And used a combination of
                a Button Array and rotating. Controller focus was passed between the different cards by
                incrementing or decrementing an index. Using that index to set the focus of a controller, 
                cursor position, and rotation. That way the game would remember where you were in the menu
                from last opening.

        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp; I built up the foundation to cover all the needs I could think of at the start, having multiple stacks
            to push menus onto and making sure the naming of the various functions matched the appropriate stack name.

            <br>
            &emsp; Development of the various menus was rapid, getting various placeholders and proof of concepts
            in place to better show the typeof assets needed to fill in the menus themselves. My concept for what
            the select menu could be VS the artists final drawings.

            &emsp; CommonUI definitely has it's quirks for working with. However, over the course of 
            this project, I cannot begin to think how much more difficult it would have been to build
            a lot of the features CommonUI has from the ground up. For the project timeline we had, 
            that was not really an option. It was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hishamata/">Hisham Ata</a>,
            one of our instructors during my course at Toronto Film School, who pushed me into CommonUI.
            I am very glad he did so. The amount of time still saved by using it, would be hard to calculate.

            Who at the start of this project, dug into UI with me. We both researched CommonUI
            and other forms of UI related tools within Unreal Engine at the start. While he moved
            away from UI to a more generalist role, I am grateful for the work done in the beginning.
            And for assisting greatly in exposing various features of the player so I could make the HUD 
            work.
