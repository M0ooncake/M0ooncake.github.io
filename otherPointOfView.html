                &emsp; The idea for this game was simple. I wanted to try and make a platformer, with good 
                feeling movement, and an extremely fluid combat system. I would like to think both 
                of those goals were achieved, though as my first ever attempt into an engine,
                it was quite ambitious. Over the course of that term, 3 months, it was very rewarding
                to see it slowly develop into what I hoped it would be.

            <h2 style="text-align: center">Pre-Development</h2>
            <p class="text-box">
                &emsp; At the start of development it was quite slow. There was a significant portion 
                of time that needed to spent looking online for various royalty free assets. 
                I needed to acquire sounds and sprites. For all sorts of different entities. <br>
                &emsp; It has been so long since I worked on this, I do not even remember where exactly 
                I found these assets to begin with. However, suffice to say, once various assets
                were gathered, work could actually begin on development.

                &emsp; During the beginning it took awhile to understand how engines work. How much work they 
                lift off the developers shoulders and handle behind the scenes. Even then that lead to needing to
                understand how to work within the bounds of said engine
