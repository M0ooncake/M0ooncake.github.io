            <p class="text-box">
                &emsp; The idea for this game was simple. I wanted to try and make a platformer, with good 
                feeling movement, and an extremely fluid combat system. it was quite ambitious for what
                time constraints there were and what lack of knowledge I had, but I was more than willing to grind
                for it. 
                <br><br> &emsp; Over the course of that term, about 10 weeks, it was very rewarding
                to see it slowly develop into what I hoped it could become.

            <h2 style="text-align: center">Pre-Development</h2>
            <p class="text-box">
                &emsp; At the start of development it was quite slow. There was a significant portion 
                of time that needed to be spent looking online for various royalty free assets. 
                I needed to acquire sounds and sprites. For all sorts of different entities. <br>
                &emsp; Itch.io was a fantastic place for finding such pieces as that site is quite
                the Indie heaven for knowledge and resources. once various assets
                were gathered, work could actually begin on development. 
            </p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center">Development</h2>
            <p class="text-box">
                &emsp; Once I learned how to properly work within Construct 3, things quickly started to take shape.
                The concept for the original game was more focused on platforming, however as it was being
                made I discovered that the combat was far more fun than just the platforming. So I decided to 
                push harder in that direction.
                <img src="imgs/gifs/DashJumpOPOV.gif" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                <br><br> &emsp; It took some time to figure out how to make an attack buffer system
                to support having multiple attacking animations. But it was figured out after some trial and error.
                I was also able to implement a parry mechanic into the game. Using multiple key frames of the enemies 
                attack animation, there is a specific frame that spawns a parry hitbox, that if struck,
                will slow time down for the enemy, allowing the player to get more attacks in before it can.
                The queue for a successful parry is a louder 'PANG' sound.

                <br><br> &emsp; Locational events were a fun thing to get working. Watching for when
                the player moves into a certain area, then queuing up multiple effects at once, and 
                altering the level layout as a result.
