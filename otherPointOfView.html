            <p class="text-box">
                &emsp; The idea for this game was simple. I wanted to try and make a platformer, with good 
                feeling movement, and an extremely fluid combat system. it was quite ambitious for what
                time constraints there were and what lack of knowledge I had, but I was more than willing to grind
                for it. 
                <br><br> &emsp; Over the course of that term, about 10 weeks, it was very rewarding
                to see it slowly develop into what I hoped it could become.

            <h2 style="text-align: center">Pre-Development</h2>
            <p class="text-box">
                &emsp; At the start of development it was quite slow. There was a significant portion 
                of time that needed to be spent looking online for various royalty free assets. 
                I needed to acquire sounds and sprites. For all sorts of different entities. <br>
                &emsp; Itch.io was a fantastic place for finding such pieces as that site is quite
                the Indie heaven for knowledge and resources. once various assets
                were gathered, work could actually begin on development.

            <p class="text-box">
                &emsp; During the beginning it took awhile to understand how engines work. How much work they 
                lift off the developers shoulders and handle behind the scenes. Even then that lead to needing to
                understand how to work within the bounds of said engine
