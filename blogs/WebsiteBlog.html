        <div class="blog-post-content, text-box">
                <p > &emsp; Over the past few days I have made big strides to get this website closer
                to being launch ready. Sometimes it can be hard to find the motivation or discipline to get at 
                it and actually get things done. However, I have gotten quite the kick of energy and focus
                with new medication I am currently taking. It has been very exciting to see this start taking 
                shape.</p>
                <p> &emsp; </p> <!--Used essentially as a spacer-->
                <p> &emsp; I had taken a break from HTML and CSS for a while. But it has been a fun time
                familiarizing myself with the language again. Seeing interesting things you can do, 
                different animations that can be pulled off and such. Perhaps the current colours may be a bit much,
                in which case I can look into changing that later. The current look pops quite a bit, and may not 
                look the best in a professional setting.</p>

                <h3>Domain Name</h3>
                <p>&emsp; Currently as it stands, the domain name is quite wack. Congratulations if you somehow
                    found this page anyway without being given the link! I would very much like to acquire a proper
                    domain for this site. But only once I feel I have gotten this site into a near complete state.</p>
                <h3>Future of The Site </h3>
                <p>&emsp; I am not yet sure where exactly I want to take this as a site. I am currently enjoying
                myself just messing around and seeing what works and what doesn't. Though that is also quite applicable
                to almost any development situation. It is often enjoyable running around in a sandbox and making
                whatever you can think of. That sort of tinkering and problem-solving is what got me into game
                development in the first place.  <br>
                &emsp; Which currently is a ways off. I need to design a press kit page 
                with all the right fixings and entries needing.
                Though, I suppose there is not much yet to enter into such a page. But having the 
                backbone of it would be fantastic. What really needs to happen is getting the pages for the 
                projects in. The portfolio pieces need to be completed. Once the first two are done,
                work can begin other pieces.</p>
