    quicker the better, notes on the bottom if you want to elaborate things.
    the deep dive would be better on the bottom so the bullet points can be quickly
    read through on top, logos for software used is good to make it more visual,
    sort of list team size, achievements for what was done, roles you played in the 
    project. Its a matter of avoiding a wall of text, essay style, those arent super
    helpful, peoples attentions spans are to short for that these days.
    
    overall
    visuals are good, logos for software, engines, all that stuff.
    Try to get an image real quick off the rip so it comes across the glance.

    colour scheme, try and use more solid colours rather then gradient. The gradient
    loses some contrast and loses some readability.

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Micro Mages by Morphcat Games 2019</h2>
        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp; This was a game that was made for the NES in 2019. I discovered
            and bought it a few years later and absolutely fell in love. It can be bought on Steam,
            and when buying, in the installed files is a ROM of the game, so you could bring it around with you
            on emulation devices. You could also buy the physical cartridge for the game itself and put it in
            the actual console. Morphcat Games released a video on YouTube, which you can watch
            <a href="https://youtu.be/ZWQ0591PAxM?si=jMWtnzhwCzYSn_QP" target="_blank">here</a>. It is a simple
            game with simple mechanics. And for this assignment in school
            I needed to remake a first level of a game of choice.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Remove your opinion. I.e. do not include things like
         This is my first time in blank.
         I'm happy with how blank turned out
         -->
        <h2 style="text-align:center">Design and Challenges</h2>
        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp; After making a list of necessary mechanics and gameplay,
            production began. Sourcing assets was not too hard, SpritersResources had a lot. However,
            some were missing and had to be recreated by hand. Similarly, audio took a while,
            and after searching around and attempting to rip the assets myself unsuccessfully, I took
            a look at the files Steam installed and discovered that all the audio assets were included
            in their raw formats.
            <br>
            <br/>&emsp; Some challenges were making jumping feel smooth, and with that, wall jumping.
            I did not expect to be too challenging, but that was very wrong. Getting the right Vector force
            to be applied to make it snappy but not overbearing was quite a bit harder than expected.
            <img src="imgs/gifs/microMagesSlide.gif" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 250px">
            
            <br>
            <br/>&emsp; So much knowledge was gained on this project, yet so much was lacking during the start that 
            it made it rather interesting throughout the development
            cycle to learn something that would have been instrumental a week after that knowledge was desperately needed.
        </p>

        <img src="imgs/Anim.png" alt="Portfolio Item 2" class="portfolio-img">
        
        <!-- Add more visuals throughout, more action shots, or even gifs would be very good.
        But more visuals, reading code is one thing, seeing it in motion is another thing.-->
        

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Successes</h2>
        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp; One of the big ones was easily the attacking. It was difficult to mimic the 
            animations and sounds from the original game; But in the end I figured out how to support
            Firing in 4 directions, correct damage sounds,
            <img src="imgs/gifs/MicroMagesShow.gif" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block; width: 250px;">
            <br><br>
            &emsp; Items were simple and effective, and the item drop rates behaved as expected. 
            Overall, a lot of knowledge was gained about the process of how making 2D platformers works, 
            hit boxes, and simple pathing for enemies and animations. 
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h2 style="text-align: center">Final Notes</h2>
        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp; I would like to reiterate that none of the art or audio assets used belong
            to me and are all Morphcat Games'. Should you wish to go and watch their own video/trailer of the game,
            please do so <a href="https://youtu.be/ZWQ0591PAxM?si=jMWtnzhwCzYSn_QP" target="_blank">here</a>.
            Additionally, should you wish to play the small first level I made, there is a link to either
            a web build or a downloadable Windows version at the top of this <a href="#TopOfPage">page</a>.
