        <h2 style="text-align:center">Micro Mages by Morphcat Games 2019</h2>
        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp;This was a game that was made for the NES in 2019. I discovered
            and bought it a few years later and absolutely fell in love. It can be bought on Steam,
            and when buying, in the installed files is a ROM of the game, so you could bring it around with you
            on emulation devices. You could also buy the physical cartridge for the game itself and put it in
            the actual console. Morphcat Games released a video on YouTube, which you can watch
            <a href="https://youtu.be/ZWQ0591PAxM?si=jMWtnzhwCzYSn_QP" target="_blank">here</a>. It is a simple
            game with simple mechanics. And for this assignment in school
            I needed to remake a first level of a game of choice.
        </p>
        
        <!-- Remove your opinion. I.e. do not include things like
         This is my first time in blank.
         I'm happy with how blank turned out
         -->
        <h2 style="text-align:center">Design and Challenges</h2>
        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp;After making a list of necessary mechanics and gameplay,
            production began. Sourcing assets was not too hard, SpritersResources had a lot. However,
            some were missing and had to be recreated by hand. Similarly, audio took a while,
            and after searching around and attempting to rip the assets myself unsuccessfully, I took
            a look at the files Steam installed and discovered that all the audio assets were included
            in their raw formats.
            <br />&emsp;Working in Unity was pretty challenging at first, but it quickly became apparent
            just how much better this engine was compared to Construct 3.
            <br />&emsp;Some of my more technical achievements I'm proud of were working with the animator
            and getting the character to be able to fire in all 4 directions.
            <br />&emsp;Other design challenges were making jumping feel smooth, and with that came wall jumping.
            Neither did I expect to be too challenging, but that was very wrong. Getting the right Vector2 force
            to be applied to make it snappy but not overbearing was quite a bit harder than I had anticipated,
            and in the end, I ran out of time to make it as polished as I would have liked.
            <br />&emsp;Perhaps the last major hurdle was lack of knowledge. So much was gained on this project,
            yet so much was lacking during the start that it made it rather interesting throughout the development
            cycle to learn something that would have been instrumental a week after that knowledge was desperately needed.

        <!-- Add more visuals throughout, more action shots, or even gifs would be very good.
        But more visuals, reading code is one thing, seeing it in motion is another thing.-->
        

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Successes</h2>
        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp; There are a few things about this project that I was extremely happy with. One of the big ones was
            easily the attacking. It was difficult to mimic the animations and sounds from the original game; 
            however, they came together so well in the end. Firing in 4 directions, correct damage sounds, 
            and projectile behavior. Jumping and fallingâ€”generally, the animations came out looking fantastic.<br><br>
            &emsp; Items also worked well. Simple as they were, they spawned properly, and the item drop rates
            seemed to behave well. The only major thing with items I didn't have time for was making the bird
            appear and allow you to float majestically like you can in the actual game. <br><br>

            &emsp; Overall, I am extremely satisfied with how it turned out in the end. 
            A lot of knowledge was gained about how crafting 2D platformers are worked on, hit boxes, and simple
            pathing for enemies. 
        </p>
        
        
        
        <h2 style="text-align: center">Final Notes</h2>
        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp; I would like to reiterate that none of the art or audio assets used belong
            to me and are all Morphcat Games'. Should you wish to go and watch their own video/trailer of the game,
            please do so <a href="https://youtu.be/ZWQ0591PAxM?si=jMWtnzhwCzYSn_QP" target="_blank">here</a>.
