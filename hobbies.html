            <h2>Electrical Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I've always had a fascination with electrical things and components as well, trying to 
                understand how computers or electronics work as a much deeper level then most people 
                ever look into in the first place.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Installing heated seats and wiring a dashcam directly into my car's fuse box.</li>
                <li>Rewiring my car's aftermarket display to fix issues with the deep sleep cycle.
                This project took probably near 7 hours. Since it was so much about debugging. It was 
                    so much about patience, changing one small thing, reconnecting a wire here, watching with
                    multimeter and then waiting 30 minutes. My Ford Fiesta enters a deep sleep at the 30 minute
                    point. From then on its supposed to draw around 5-10 miliamps. However, after that time period
                    was done, it would still draw upwards of 400 miliamps. Which, within about 8 hours, would 
                    totally drain the battery. I did eventually make a temporary solution for it. Having a
                    switch in the glove box to cut accessory power to the head unit. I did order also order
                    a "True off time delay relay" so that I could wire it in to automate the on and off of the display.
                    But, as everyone knows. Nothing is as permanent as a temporary solution. 
                </li>
                <li>3ds capture card. This project was an enjoyable nightmare. It took around 8 hours
                    to solder a daughter board onto the motherboard. It was very delicate work. Soldering 
                    directly with, to, and on ribbon cables. Where, if you keep your iron on it a bit to long, it 
                    very well might burn, and then you're screwed. I almost did that a good few times. It was 
                    a very exhausting job, but i'm glad I got it done. It works, I can stream both screens 
                    directly to the PC and have streamed it before on Twitch.

            </ul>
            <p>
                Each project presents a unique challenge, from troubleshooting to creative problem-solving.
