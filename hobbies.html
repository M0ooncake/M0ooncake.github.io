            <h2 style="text-align: center">Electrical Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; I've always had a fascination with electrical things and components as well, trying to 
                understand how computers or electronics work as a much deeper level then most people 
                ever look into in the first place.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Installing heated seats and wiring a dashcam directly into my car's fuse box.</li>
                <li>Rewiring my car's aftermarket display to fix issues with the deep sleep cycle.
                This project took probably near 7 hours. Since it was so much about debugging. It was 
                    so much about patience, changing one small thing, reconnecting a wire here, watching with
                    multimeter and then waiting 30 minutes. My Ford Fiesta enters a deep sleep at the 30 minute
                    point. From then on its supposed to draw around 5-10 miliamps. However, after that time period
                    was done, it would still draw upwards of 400 miliamps. Which, within about 8 hours, would 
                    totally drain the battery. I did eventually make a temporary solution for it. Having a
                    switch in the glove box to cut accessory power to the head unit. I did order also order
                    a "True off time delay relay" so that I could wire it in to automate the on and off of the display.
                    But, as everyone knows. Nothing is as permanent as a temporary solution. 
                </li>
                <li>3ds capture card. This project was an enjoyable nightmare. It took around 8 hours
                    to solder a daughter board onto the motherboard. It was very delicate work. Soldering 
                    directly with, to, and on ribbon cables. Where, if you keep your iron on it a bit to long, it 
                    very well might burn, and then you're screwed. I almost did that a good few times. It was 
                    a very exhausting job, but i'm glad I got it done. It works, I can stream both screens 
                    directly to the PC and have streamed it before on Twitch.
                </li> 
            </ul>
            <p>
                &emsp; Each small-ish project has taught me so much in those areas. Figuring out how to properly
                work on the car and its various fuses and measuring things like parasitic draws.
                With the 3DS, trying to work with stupidly delicate ribbon cables and how to
                be to patient when it came to plugging those back in. For if I messed that up,
                the board was cooked. I'd like to get into Micro Soldering myself, but I need
                a lot better equipment for that then I currently posses.

            <h2 style="text-align: center">Physical Hobbies</h2>
            <h2>Cubs and Camping</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; I've always enjoyed doing various activities outside. 
                I was a part of a cub scouts troop for around 5 or so years.
                Doing a lot of outdoor activities, nature walks, park/highway cleanups, camping trips
                and so on. And in winter we go snow shoeing, skiing and building Quinzhees (think 
                an Igloo made of piling snow and hollowing it out).
                <br><br>&emsp; Afterwards in High School years I took a 
                “Outdoor Pursuits” class, wherein we would spend a lot of time learning about different
                aspects of wilderness. That involved learning different tools or procedures 
                used during camping, how to cook on small propane camp stoves, tying a large 
                variety of knots and more. Participating in multi day camping trips and canoeing trips.

            <br>
            <h2>LARP</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; in 2024 I joined a local LARP group, Forgotten Empires. Now, if you asked
                a nerd if they thought the idea of roughing it in the woods, getting about 30k steps a day,
                sprinting and exercising in 30-40C heat, eating quite frankly not enough and always being
                parched, sounded like fun. They'd likely call you insane. However. Make it like 
                living DND, that happens in real time. And you may get a different answer.
                <br><br>&emsp; That was the case for me. I never thought LARP would be something that interested
                me. The idea that I had in my head, was that it was fairly boring. Just a group of 
                people in customs who acted ridiculous for a weekend or X period of time. And, while 
                some of that is true, we can be ridiculous, it is nowhere near boring. So, so far from it.
                The world of Forgotten Empires is quite frankly insane. Detailed lore, magic system, 
                pantheon of Deities, and so so much more. It really is like a very complex DND world,
                but we live it. Instead of rolling dice to attack, we are actively swinging various
                foam weapons at one another. Swords, Axes, Spears, Knives, Great-swords and bows.
                <br><br>&emsp; There is a vast and complicated skill, and magic system. All doing various effects
                and 'casting time' and verbal calls. For example as spells gain levels, there are fewer
                spell slots, similar to DND. However, unlike DND, this LARP group has incantations that 
                must be recited before throwing a 'packet'. Which is bird seed tied in a piece of cloth.
                As spell levels get higher, they must have more syllables. One of my fellow LARPer's has 
                a 9th level spell, and before throwing the spell at someone, they must recite 
                <br><br>&emsp; "Become struck with the power of the sun" then says 9 divine, the effect of the spell. 
                Dealing 9 divine damage.
                <br><br>&emsp; Which doesn't seem bad. But put yourself in a 20 vs 20 person battle, with formations and 
                a front-line and back-line with shouting and yelling and threats all around, it becomes very 
                overwhelming at first. You get used to it, and learn and adapt, but it is truly a lot all
                at once.
                <br><br>&emsp; It is absolutely an unforgettable experience. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>HEMA – Historical European Martial Arts</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; If you liked being in the woods as a child, and grabbing sticks
                and pretending to fight off various monsters or your friends. HEMA is like 
                that. But on steroids. Being actually trained in blade combat is something that
                every adventurous kid dreams of. And even in the small city I've grown up in, 
                there is a gym for it. 
                <br><br>&emsp; The system of one hand sword fighting that I was
                instructed with was Roworth's Art of Defense. Which was a fighting
                style that was designed to rapidly teach new soldiers how to fight
                with, really any, single hand object or weapon. Roworth Published this book
                in 1798 for the British Military to use. There were 7 basic cuts that get taught. 
                This is what it looks like in practice
                <br>
                <img src="imgs/artOfDefense.png" style=" width: 400px; border-radius: 15px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
                <br>&emsp; Just add a 7 at the top of the vertical line. And that is the 7 cuts.
                Of course, there are many different defensive actions you take to parry, block, 
                and much more. But if you would like to learn about that, there is a section
                on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Defence_on_Foot_with_the_Broad_Sword_and_Sabre">Wikipedia</a>
                down near the bottom that has links to a place where you can view various editions of 
                this book. I am also learning German Longsword. That, is so much more complicated
                then Roworths is. Afterall, you are using two hands on one sword. It gets complicated fast.
                Suffice to say, HEMA is incredible exercise, and a WILD experience. 
                <br>&emsp; And yes! If you were curious, HEMA has given me a very significant skill
                advantage over the majority of LARPers at my group, given most have no real 
                weapons training.

            <h2 style="text-align: center">Gaming</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; For the most part, I think it goes without saying. No duh, a game developer, liking
                video games? It's unheard of! Truly a new frontier.
                <br>&emsp; However, sarcasm aside. It IS something I quite enjoy doing. While I was
                 a student with Toronto Film School however, gaming took a very heavy back burner. I
                was so busy with the copious amounts of class work that was being given out that I
                never really had time to actually enjoy playing themself. But, now that I have graduated
                I have lots of time to explore gaming again. And wow, is it quite the breath of fresh air.

            <h2>Favorites right now</h2>
            <p>
                <li> Horizon Zero Dawn</li>
                &emsp; Its been awhile since I've played it. But it was one of the first games 
                of it's type that I played. That being a open world, narrative driven game. 
                <li>Overwatch (1)</li>
                &emsp; I stopped playing for the most part when OW2 was released. But up until
                then I was a pretty active player. I imagine from PS4 to PC, I may have somewhere around 
                3000 hours or so. Having been a player since season... 4 I think it was. Back then, 
                it was a very different game.
                <li>To The Moon, and series.</li>
                &emsp; I fell in love with this game and its series. Bringing me to tears at many points.
                Finding Paradise, it's sequel, broke me even more. They are fantastically done 
                little RPG games made with RPG maker. 
                <li>Octopath Traveller, and OT2</li>
                &emsp; I have sunk well over 200 hours combined into both games. Similar to To The Moon,
                there were many parts that had me in an absolute sobbing fit. Castii, from OT2, was my 
                favorite by far. And dear heavens. The amount of violent sobbing her story inflicted 
                upon me is crazy. But, it was just so sad and beautiful. The song "Empty Memories"
                still gets me emotional just listening to it. 
                <br><br>&emsp; A bunch of quick hits, and honourable mentions. Otherwise I'll be here
                for a month writing out all this.
                <br> <li>Apex Legends</li>

                <li>A lot of other DS and 3DS games.</li>
                <br>&emsp; These are not all the games I've played and enjoy, but they are a lot
                of the mot recent ones. And as you an see, there is a large smattering of different 
                genres and types. I like to try and experience a wide range of them.
