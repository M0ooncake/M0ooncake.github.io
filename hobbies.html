            <h2>Electrical Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; I've always had a fascination with electrical things and components as well, trying to 
                understand how computers or electronics work as a much deeper level then most people 
                ever look into in the first place.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Installing heated seats and wiring a dashcam directly into my car's fuse box.</li>
                <li>Rewiring my car's aftermarket display to fix issues with the deep sleep cycle.
                This project took probably near 7 hours. Since it was so much about debugging. It was 
                    so much about patience, changing one small thing, reconnecting a wire here, watching with
                    multimeter and then waiting 30 minutes. My Ford Fiesta enters a deep sleep at the 30 minute
                    point. From then on its supposed to draw around 5-10 miliamps. However, after that time period
                    was done, it would still draw upwards of 400 miliamps. Which, within about 8 hours, would 
                    totally drain the battery. I did eventually make a temporary solution for it. Having a
                    switch in the glove box to cut accessory power to the head unit. I did order also order
                    a "True off time delay relay" so that I could wire it in to automate the on and off of the display.
                    But, as everyone knows. Nothing is as permanent as a temporary solution. 
                </li>
                <li>3ds capture card. This project was an enjoyable nightmare. It took around 8 hours
                    to solder a daughter board onto the motherboard. It was very delicate work. Soldering 
                    directly with, to, and on ribbon cables. Where, if you keep your iron on it a bit to long, it 
                    very well might burn, and then you're screwed. I almost did that a good few times. It was 
                    a very exhausting job, but i'm glad I got it done. It works, I can stream both screens 
                    directly to the PC and have streamed it before on Twitch.

            </ul>
            <p>
                &emsp; Each project presents a unique challenge, from troubleshooting to creative problem-solving.

            <h2>Outdoors Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; I've always enjoyed doing various activities outside. 
                I was a part of a cub scouts troop for around 5 or so years.
                Doing a lot of outdoor activities, nature walks, park/highway cleanups, camping trips
                and so on. And in winter we go snow shoeing, skiing and building Quinzhees (think 
                an Igloo made of piling snow and hollowing it out).
                <br><br>&emsp; Afterwards in High School years I took a 
                “Outdoor Pursuits” class, wherein we would spend a lot of time learning about different
                aspects of wilderness. That involved learning different tools or procedures 
                used during camping, how to cook on small propane camp stoves, tying a large 
                variety of knots and more. Participating in multi day camping trips and canoeing trips.

            <h2>LARP</h2>
            <p>
               &emsp; in 2024 I joined a local LARP group, Forgotten Empires. Now, if you asked
                a nerd if they thought the idea of roughing it in the woods, getting about 30k steps a day,
                sprinting and exercising in 30-40C heat, eating quite frankly not enough and always being
                parched, sounded like fun. They'd likely call you insane. However. Make it like 
                living DND, that happens in real time. And you may get a different answer.
