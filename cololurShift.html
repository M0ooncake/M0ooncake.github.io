    quicker the better, notes on the bottom if you want to elaborate things.
    the deep dive would be better on the bottom so the bullet points can be quickly
    read through on top, logos for software used is good to make it more visual,
    sort of list team size, achievements for what was done, roles you played in the 
    project. Its a matter of avoiding a wall of text, essay style, those arent super
    helpful, peoples attentions spans are to short for that these days.
    
    overall
    visuals are good, logos for software, engines, all that stuff.
    Try to get an image real quick off the rip so it comes across the glance.

                &emsp; At the start, it took us awhile to figure out what we wanted to do. And how to go about doing it.
                At this point, it was our first time touching GitHub. So it took us awhile to get started. 
                We pitched various game ideas, from multiplayer tower defense games to, this. 
                <br><br>
                &emsp; The original game concept was created by Emmanuel SC, and the rest of the time
                quite liked the idea he put forth. So we started organising into various teams, 
                dividing responsibility up between us.
                <br><br>
                &emsp;  The User Interface was my primary responsibility, with the aid from Piper T, we got started.
                As the weeks rolled on it started to take shape, and we were discovering different ways to approach 
                menu navigation. {Add Images!!}
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 style="text-align:center">Menu Backend</h2>
        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp; The menu initially worked by enabling and disabling the respective game objects.
            It wasn't a fantastic solution, but it worked for that. As the project progressed, and
            we needed to start showing it to be graded. I was rightly flamed pretty good by the Instructor 
            at the time. He explained a different way to go about it, asking if I had even heard of what a 
            menu stack was. But instead of just dunking on me, he opened the door to exploration.
            <br><br>
            &emsp; He offered guidance on where to look. Some different concepts to look into, and pathways 
            that could be traveled. Thus, I went and revamped the whole system, rebuilding it from the ground
            up. After it was complete, he jokingly said something along the lines of 
            <br><br> &emsp; "Well why the hell didn't you do this the first time?"
        </p>

        
        

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Closing Notes</h2>
        <p class="text-box">
            &emsp; We needed some sprites to be quickly put together for the HUD. So I put together 
            the heart sprites, and the keyboard arrow sprites to show what the combo was to colour.
            <br><br>
            &emsp; That small bit of pixel art has interested me into the art-form enough that I have started
            exploring it since as well.
            <br><br>
            &emsp; This project came together in about 2 months over all, so much has been learned from it,
            it was a completely different experience working with a large group instead of solo. And it really 
            fanned the flames of passion for game making, seeing what can be done in a large group hands on.
