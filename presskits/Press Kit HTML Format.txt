<p><strong>ABOUT THE GAME<br></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Building a satisfying vertical platformer can be hard on mobile with limited button space, so I looked to Shoot 'em Ups for inspiration. Rather than jumping between platforms, the focus became dodging enemies, leaping over bullets and keeping ahead of the ever scrolling screen! Things really came together when I found it's protagonist whilst doodling - A baboon with a gun on it's head (BABOOM).</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT ME</strong></p>
<p>I'm a games developer based out of Cambridge, I've been building games for around 7 years. I learnt how to code teaching kids Stencyl in upstate New York then decided to make my own games.</p>
<p>Along with designing games, I also create weird custom controllers. These are usually made with cardboard, foil, lots of crocodile clips and kitchen sponges. Several have been built into proper installations, for example;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ouqw_iX5CU" target="_blank">boxing puppets</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8byStvOKqf0" target="_blank">Morse Code switchboards</a>&nbsp;and recently a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWgk6qjyRYU&t=2s" target="_blank">surgical table with a syringe controller!</a></p>
